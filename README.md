# Asteroids_Playable
Playable version of Asteroids game made with codename1

This is the playable version of the game Asteroids, that is made from the GUI and the text versions of the very game that I 
made earlier. The test and the GUI part is mostly retained, but now aminations and sounds are added, complete with drawable 
objects on the screen with colours . Collision is implemented, with sounds. More options added in terms of GUI and some removed.

Fixed all bugs from the previous text and GUI versions.
